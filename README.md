#  BLE Connectivity
This project is a [Red Shirt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(stock_character)) project from Per Friis, used to experiment and refine the usage of swift Async/Await when working with BLE devices. 
You might already have tried to work with BLE using CoreBluetooth, and man thats a drag.

The BLE protocol is old and kind of obsolete, but I don't think that we get a new standard for years to come. And even if we did, there will be BLE devices to connect to for ages to come.

Therefor, it is nice to have a "pattern", when connecting, reading and writing to BLE gatt.

This is my take on it, and please note that I use this a the "playground" for refining the pattern and you are welcome to look into the code and used the code what ever way that may fit your need. Just note, that I'm not reliable for the code that you, create or copy from this project. that's on you.

If you get inspired, are using things from this code, I would appreciate any credit you can muster to add to your code, website etc.

I expect to keep using this project, as I get more knowledge and find new better patterns all the time. so checkin once in a wile, and see if I have created some updates.
